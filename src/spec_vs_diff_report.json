  "summary": "Diff adds a Settings entry point in the authenticated chat header and introduces a Settings dialog that shows the current user’s full principal with copy-to-clipboard + toast feedback. It also selects the user list based on admin status (useGetAllUsers vs useGetChatUsers) and filters out the current user from the displayed list. Due to truncation of SettingsDialog.tsx, the per-user row rendering (full principal + per-row copy button) cannot be fully verified from the provided diff summary.",
